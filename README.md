# Expression

Expression is a **WebApp** for **Sentiment Analysis**. A social platform where people can share opinions about topics of interest on real-time. People can start sharing opinions anonymously or sign up to follow topics and get notified when the sentiment and opinion tendency about a topic changes. Expression is a proof of concept prototype.
